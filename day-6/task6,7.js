// Write an if condition to check that age is between 14 and 90 inclusively.

// “Inclusively” means that age can reach the edges 14 or 90.

if (age >= 14 && age <= 90) {
    //...
}

// Write an if condition to check that age is NOT between 14 and 90 inclusively.

// Create two variants: the first one using NOT !, the second one – without it.
