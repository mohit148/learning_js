    // it is the shorthand for if else statement
    // syntax: condition ? value1 : value2;
    // ? : conditional operator is called ternary operator because it takes three operands first is condition, second is value1 and third is value2
    // if condition is true, value1 is returned to result otherwise value2 is returned

       
// The ternary operator takes **three expressions**:

// 1. A condition
// 2. A value if true
// 3. A value if false

// Even though the first is a condition, all three are treated as **operands** because the ternary operator uses them to decide and return one final value.


// The ternary operator in JavaScript is written as ? :  both symbols together form one operator.
// The : alone is not an operator; it's part of the ternary operator's syntax.
