// a variable can at one moment be a string and then store a number or boolean or any other type of data
//  this is called dynamic typing
// and the programming language that supports this is called dynamically typed language
// It is recommendd to declare new variavle instead of reusing the same variable
// in other languages like C, C++, Java, you have to declare the type of variable
// however, dynamic typing  doesnot works in constant variables, means you cannot change the value or data type of a constant variable
